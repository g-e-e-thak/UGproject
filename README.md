# UGproject
This was the code I used for my final year UG project "Light curve analysis - Determination of exoplanet parameters - Kepler 5b."

You can use this code for any Kepler system to construct light curves.

I decided to use python although it wasn't necessary to use it for construction, because the datasets were in text format and a lot of data cleaning and conversion had to be done.

Also! Plotly is an amazing visualisation tool!

The datasets are two in number. 

	One from Kepler space probe's observation used to construct light curve and folded light curve.
	
	The other is from ground based telescopes and contains information about the star's doppler shift. This is used to make the radial velocity curve.

The datasets are provided but can also be obtained from https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/kepler_hlsp/, the MAST archive.
