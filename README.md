# UGproject
This was the code I used for my final year UG project "Light curve analysis - Determination of exoplanet parameters - Kepler 5b."
You can use this code for any Kepler system to construct light curves.
I decided to use python although it wasn't necessary to use it for construction, because the datasets were in text format and a lot of data cleaning and conversion had to be done.
Also! Plotly is an amazing visualisation tool!
